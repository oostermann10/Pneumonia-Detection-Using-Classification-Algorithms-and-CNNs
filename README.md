In this project, I explored the task of classifying if a patient had pneumonia or not based on their chest radiograph scan. I used various dimensionality reduction techniques as the images were highly complex to process. The reduction techniques I used and compared were principal component analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding, locally linear embedding, and multidimensional scaling. I further explored various supervised classification algorithms and compared how they performed on different reduced forms of the images. The algorithms I explored and hyperparameter-tuned were stochastic gradient descent classifiers, support vector machines, random forests, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbours, and Gaussian naive Bayes classifiers. I further explored some sequential neural network models on the various forms of reduced data and evaluated their learning curves to identify over/underfitting issues. Lastly, I created two convolutional neural networks, one that was quite simple as a baseline, and one that had many layers and was more complex. I was able to achieve about 95% accuracy with the second network.

Thank you for checking out my project!
